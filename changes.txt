To v1.70 (June 28 2003)
=======================

========
    - fixed: sig handler

    - &apply_changes: first creating backups then wait
    - &apply_changes: waiting 2 secs instead of 3 now
    - &apply_changes: users to be added / removed are logged to $proj.log
    - &apply_changes: user first removed, then added
    - &apply_changes: shifted compression type:
