To v1.73.3 (August 10 2003)
===========================
- fixed the assistant help text to reflect changes of recent versions
- removed v3 date codec (year-2038 bug), v4 is alias for v2

To v1.73 (July 22 2003)
=======================
- fixed: users with duplicate real name (but though different birthdate) were
  ignored and only one was added to the Addition List.
- fixed: the 7th parameter (skeleton dir) was never passed to useradd and
  friends
- added: running a preadd script is now possible when adding a single user
- added: running a postdel script is now possible when deleting a single user
- fixed: when adding a single user:
  - "useradd" was always run, ignoring p_useradd and pa_useradd
  - a possible postadd script was not executed properly
- fixed: when deleting a single user:
  - "userdel" was always run, ignoring p_userdel and pa_userdel
  - a possible predel script was not executed properly
- fixed: a varname difference rejected archiving a user home directory
  (single user delete); plus more
- fixed a memory leak (add/keep/del lists were not reset correctly)
- using new date v3 scrambler
- fixed: logic error, was using scalar context where list context was
  needed
- fixed: worked around an unusual sprintf behavior
- fixed a copy and paste error
- added: moved addition of users before deletion so UIDs do not get reused
  that fast
- fixed: default compression was not .tbz2 but .tar

To v1.71 (July 04 2003)
=======================
- fixed: base config (dautool.cfg) file did not got read (since v1.70)
- fixed: if the destination group did not exist, a warning was
  displayed -- but without the group's name
- fixed: crontabs of users-to-be-deleted were not properly removed
- added: user-defined args for useradd, userdel and additional progs
- fixed: various logic errors in config file
- removed: since the accepted file formats are only SDF, the format enum query
  has been commented out
- various variable fixes
* v1.70 HAS BEEN MARKED AS UNSTABLE + UNUSABLE. Unstable: Changed variable
  names were not updated in certain parts of the code, leading to incomplete
  system() calls. Unusable: Luckily, exactly this lead to a conditional always
  being false and thus never let you do anything.

To v1.70 (June 28 2003)
=======================
- fixed: genpass() generated a wrong salt in some cases (it used unallowed
  characters) (btw... this was the 3rd salt problem since the beginning)
- reordered a2a.pm and codec.pm

To v1.60
========
    - fixed: password generation routine generated illegal one-char salts
      (probability 3.149%)

To v1.50
========
    - fixed: naughty typo around line 489 ($CURR{"s_dtrfile"} => $dtrfile)
    - added: p_preadd, p_postdel program possibilities

To v1.42
========
    - fixed: sig handler
    - fixed: &getgrent ... routines and their implementation
    - if an error/warning occurs, we print either "ERROR:" or "WARNING:",
      following their meaning (warning => continue, error => stop)
    - &assitant: finished it
    - &apply_changes: first creating backups then wait
    - &apply_changes: waiting 2 secs instead of 3 now
    - &apply_changes: users to be added / removed are logged to $proj.log
    - &apply_changes: user first removed, then added
    - &apply_changes: shifted compression type:
      0 => do not backup homedir
      1 => tar
      2 => tar-bzip2 (standard in base/dautool.cfg)
    - &useradd: fixed typo "UPW" to "DTR"
    - &recover: is untested
