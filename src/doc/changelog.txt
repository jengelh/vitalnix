v3.2.0 (2008-01-02)
===================
- renamed tools to have unique prefixes (please look into the
  Vitalnix bin and sbin directories for new names)
- added tools: vxfinger, vxid, vxgroupbld, userwebpages.cgi
- documentation
- added manpages (generated from HTML)
- initial secondary group support (drv_ldap, drv_mmd)
- added SHA-256 and SHA-512 password hashing

- [r551]: calling -V in various tools did not terminate the program
- [r552]: vxckuuid forgot to check for -i parameter
- [r553]: vxgroup{add,mod,del} forgot to check for first argument presence
- [r618]: programs' -M option (select database) has been renamed to --vxdb
- [r619]: rename {user,group}{add,mod,del}'s -A and -B options to --after
  and --before to avoid clashes with pwdutils
- [r636]: added MD5 password hashing code, not having to rely on Glibc anymore
