# Use the split home feature (Ã  la SourceForge):
# level 0: /home/username
# level 1: /home/u/username
# level 2: /home/u/us/username
# This is useful so they can be spread across multiple, possibly NFS, disks.

# The umask to create the directory with. The current umask from the process
# which useradd is running from is ignored, thus, the directory will have the
# mode 0777 & ~umask. (0066 is ok, since it is useful to have the execute bit
# to allow entrance to other users, e.g. wwwrun, to look for /home/user/www
# (browse there), but deny /home/user itself.)
