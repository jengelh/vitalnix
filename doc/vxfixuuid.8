.SH "Description"
.PP
The \fBvxfixuuid\fP utility is used to regenerate the Vitalnix UUID of a user
when the data that was used to generate the UUID has changed, mostly due to
typographic fixes. If the UUID was not corrected by the time the user database
is synchronized again to the External Data Source (e.g. using
\fBvxusersync\fP(8)), the user will be deleted and instantly be readded with a
new username, new password and fresh home directory.
.PP
When no UUID is provided by the External Data Source, as is the case with
Kolleg/SDF, the UUID is generated from the birthdate and the real name, so if
either change upstream, the UUID needs to be adjusted. If the External Data
Source \fIdoes\fP already provide a UUID, then there is no problem.
