This is a very cut down example of a real world example. What contained is my
very own entry as I can not pass any confidental data.

Remember, any unknown fields are ignored by the parser. Fields known are
"nname", "vname", "xuid" and "sgroup". That "src" is provided here is a remnant
(though, leave it in) of the SDF2XML utility.

<datasource>
    <user nname="Engelhardt" vname="Jan" src="22.5.86" xuid="0_7C2516" sgroup="12" />
