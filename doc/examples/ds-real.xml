This is a very cut down example of a real world example. What contained is my
very own entry as I can not pass any confidental data.

Remember, any unknown fields are ignored by the parser. Fields known are
"nname", "vname", "xuid" and "sgroup". That "src" is provided here is a remnant
(though, leave it in) of the SDF2XML utility.
